A total of 107 small RNA-seq libraries from four different poplar 
species (Populus deltoides, Populus euphratica, Populus tremula, 
and Populus trichocarpa) were comprehensively analyzed by using this
python scripts.

The sample ID were described below:
    Populus deltoides:
      SRR10398907-17
      SRR7525690-98
      SRR11625356-73
    Populus euphratica:
      SRR3747766-74
      SRR6356670-78
      SRR6359093-100
      SRR7945071-81
    Populus tremula:
      SRR11575078-83
      SRR11575708-19
    Populus trichocarpa:
      SRR7525699-707
      GSM717875-77

As a result, 142, 153, 157, and 153 miRNA loci were de novo identified 
successively in P. deltoides, P. euphratica, P. tremula, and P. trichocarpa, 
respectively.

Interestingly, the length distribution of identified miRNAs was between 20 and 24 nt, 
with the peak at 21 nt. A significant bias towards U (67.4%) was observed in the first
nucleotides of miRNA sequences.

The same method was used in miRNA identification in Ginkgo, Taxus and Amygdalus 
and achieved credible results.
